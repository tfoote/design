##Learning ROS

Depending on your learning style and preferences, you can take two approaches to learning ROS: 

 * [Start the Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) - Dive in right away and start working with ROS.  

 * [Get an Overview](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction) - Read through this written overview of ROS and its capabilities.  

For more detailed information on the ROS framework, see the [core ROS documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS).

##Finding Answers

There are three places to look for answers to your questions and problems. The first is this wiki. Try the '''Search''' feature located at the top right.

If you can't find a solution to your problem, then try searching [http://answers.ros.org](http://answers.ros.org) or the [archived mailing list](http://lists.ros.org/lurker/list/ros-users.en.html). Ask a question on [http://answers.ros.org/ask](http://answers.ros.org/ask)

Check out the [Support](http://wiki.ros.org/Support) page for more information.

##Finding Code

Wondering if there is already a ROS package out there that does what you need? The [Browse Software](http://www.ros.org/browse/) tool also lets search for useful [packages](http://wiki.ros.org/Packages). You can also browse the list of public ROS [repositories](http://wiki.ros.org/RecommendedRepositoryUsage/CommonGitHubOrganizations) to look for groups doing similar work.
